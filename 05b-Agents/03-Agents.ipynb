We then deploy the Agent to [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/agents-tools-runtime.html), which provides a secure, serverless and purpose-built hosting environment for deploying and running AI agents or tools, completely model and framework agnostic.\n",

This is often accomplished through function calling, where the agent can invoke specific tools based on user requests and context. Strands Agent already comes with some built-in tools but also allows to create custom tools. Let's explore both.\n",

    "AgentCore Runtime is a secure, serverless runtime purpose-built for deploying and scaling dynamic AI agents and tools using any open-source framework including LangGraph, CrewAI, and Strands Agents, any protocol, and any model. Runtime was built to work for agentic workloads with industry-leading extended runtime support, fast cold starts, true session isolation, built-in identity, and support for multi-modal payloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Benefits of AgentCore Runtime:\n",
    "- **Framework Agnostic**: Deploy agents built with any framework (Strands, LangGraph, CrewAI) without modification\n",
    "- **Extended Runtime Support**: Handle long-running agentic workflows (up to 8h) that exceed traditional serverless limits\n",
    "- **True Session Isolation**: Each agent invocation runs in complete isolation (VM-level) for security and reliability\n",
    "- **Fast Cold Starts**: Optimized for quick agent initialization, reducing latency for sporadic workloads\n",
    "- **Built-in Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and tracing for agent performance and debugging out of the box\n",
    "- **Enterprise Security**: Integrated identity management and secure execution environment\n",

    "In this notebook, we successfully created a GenAI Agent using Strands Agent SDK and deployed it to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime. We built a restaurant assistant that can retrieve information from a Bedrock Knowledge Base and manage reservations in DynamoDB, demonstrating how to combine built-in and custom tools to create powerful agentic applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Accomplishments\n",
    "- Created a Strands Agent with Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet as the underlying LLM\n",
    "- Integrated built-in tools (current_time, retrieve) and custom tools (booking management)\n",
    "- Deployed the agent to a secure, serverless AgentCore Runtime environment\n",
    "- Successfully tested the agent's capabilities for restaurant information retrieval and reservation management\n",

    "Your journey doesn't end here. Amazon Bedrock AgentCore provides AgentCore Gateway, AgentCore Identity, AgentCore Memory, AgentCore Observability, and many more interesting features that will help you build enterprise-ready generative AI Agents.
