    "AgentCore Runtime is a secure, serverless runtime purpose-built for deploying and scaling dynamic AI agents and tools using any open-source framework including LangGraph, CrewAI, and Strands Agents, any protocol, and any model. Runtime was built to work for agentic workloads with industry-leading extended runtime support, fast cold starts, true session isolation, built-in identity, and support for multi-modal payloads. Developers can focus on innovation while Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime handles infrastructure and security—accelerating time-to-market"
